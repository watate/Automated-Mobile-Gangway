# Automated Mobile Gangway
The goal of this project is to build an automated, mobile, battery-powered gangway that would allow persons to safely cross the gap between the wharf and a vessel. My role in this project is to provide an end-to-end design for the controls of the gangway.

In this repository, you will find:
1. Arduino code ("me3103_2.ino")
2. Wiring schematic ("wiring_schematic.pdf")
3. Design considerations and documentation in markdown and pdf ("amg_documentation.md")
